# ENVO variable Parser

Prolog grammar for parsing complex compositional variables into expressions

## Results

IN PROGRESS.

See [target/parse.txt](target/parse.txt) for very early results.

So far we are just doing a basic syntactic parse to generate a tree. This tree can then be mapped to OWL.

## Quickstart

Type:

`make`

(todo: docker environment)

## TODO

 - use UO in ontology conversion
 - use PATO (flux etc) as terminals
 - use ENVO material entity for 'in' and 'into'
 - use ENVO process for wind etc
 - Dockerify
